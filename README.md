# KraloveBot
Add this bot and assign it a channel to listen to Kralove events in real time.  

Use `/listen` inside a Text Channel to mark that channel as a listener for Kralove Information. 

Set a `/role` that will be used to notify you of how many characters are needed in each tile room! 
  
 That's it! Let's all work together to get Kralove open as much as possible!
